# Role Permission Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented role-based permission system in the UpdateProfile component to prevent unauthorized role changes.

## Implemented Rules

### üö´ USER Role Restrictions
- **Cannot change their own role** - The role select field is disabled
- **Can only see USER option** - Only their current role is available in the dropdown
- **Read-only role field** with clear messaging about the restriction

### üõ°Ô∏è ORG_ADMIN Role Restrictions  
- **Cannot upgrade to SUPER_ADMIN** - SUPER_ADMIN option is not available in dropdown
- **Can choose from:** USER, MANAGER, ORG_ADMIN
- **Clear warning message** displayed about the SUPER_ADMIN restriction

### ‚úÖ MANAGER Role Permissions
- **Can change role between:** USER, MANAGER
- **Cannot upgrade to:** ORG_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN

### üîì SUPER_ADMIN Role Permissions
- **Full access** - Can choose any role including downgrading themselves
- **Can choose from:** USER, MANAGER, ORG_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/Components/UpdateProfile.tsx` - Main implementation

### New Functions Added
1. **`canChangeRole()`** - Determines if current user can modify their role
2. **`getAvailableRoles()`** - Returns array of roles available to current user
3. **`getRoleDisplayName()`** - Maps role enum to user-friendly display names

### UI Changes
- Role select field becomes **disabled** for USER role
- **Dynamic options** based on current user's role and permissions
- **Contextual help text** explains restrictions
- **Visual styling** for disabled states (grayed out, cursor-not-allowed)
- **Warning message** for ORG_ADMIN about SUPER_ADMIN restriction

### Validation
- **Client-side validation** in form submission prevents invalid role changes
- **Server-side validation** should also be implemented in Firebase Security Rules (recommended)

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Protection ‚úÖ
- Form validation prevents submission of invalid role changes
- UI clearly shows available options based on current role
- Role select field disabled for users who cannot change roles

### Backend Protection üîÑ (Recommended Next Steps)
- **Firebase Security Rules** should mirror these restrictions
- **Custom claims validation** in Firebase Functions
- **Audit logging** for role changes

## Testing

### Test Results ‚úÖ
Created and ran comprehensive test suite (`test-role-permissions.cjs`):

- ‚úÖ USER cannot change role (only sees USER option)
- ‚úÖ ORG_ADMIN cannot upgrade to SUPER_ADMIN  
- ‚úÖ MANAGER can choose USER or MANAGER
- ‚úÖ SUPER_ADMIN has full access to all roles
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login as USER - verify role field is disabled
- [ ] Login as MANAGER - verify can choose USER/MANAGER only
- [ ] Login as ORG_ADMIN - verify SUPER_ADMIN not available
- [ ] Login as SUPER_ADMIN - verify all roles available
- [ ] Test form submission with invalid role changes
- [ ] Verify proper error messages and UI feedback

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **USER role:** Role field will be grayed out and read-only
2. **MANAGER/ORG_ADMIN:** Can select from available roles in dropdown
3. **SUPER_ADMIN:** Full access to change to any role

### For Developers
The permission logic is centralized in helper functions within UpdateProfile.tsx:
- Modify `getAvailableRoles()` to change role permissions
- Modify `canChangeRole()` to change who can edit roles
- UI automatically adapts based on these functions

## Security Notes

### Current Protection Level: Frontend Only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è These restrictions are **client-side only**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Malicious users could potentially bypass frontend restrictions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend validation is essential** for production security

### Recommended Backend Security
```javascript
// Example Firebase Security Rule
allow update: if 
  // Users can only update their own profile
  request.auth.uid == userId &&
  // Role changes must follow permission rules
  (
    // USER cannot change role
    (resource.data.rol == 'user' && request.data.rol == 'user') ||
    // ORG_ADMIN cannot become SUPER_ADMIN
    (resource.data.rol == 'org_admin' && request.data.rol != 'super_admin') ||
    // SUPER_ADMIN can change to anything
    (resource.data.rol == 'super_admin')
  );
```

## Files Created
- `test-role-permissions.cjs` - Test script for validation
- `ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
All requested role permission restrictions have been implemented and tested.
